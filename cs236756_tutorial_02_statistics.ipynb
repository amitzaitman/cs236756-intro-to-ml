For example, the number of cases to study for a given problem is a variable. Thus a researcher might choose a population of 100 people or 150 people, depending on various statistical requirements. This would count as a variable. A parameter, on the other hand, will be independent of the variable and the number of cases that are taken to study. In fact, the parameters will fix the distribution irrespective of the total number of cases under study.\n",

    "1. **Null & Alternative Hypotheses** -  Formulate the null hypothesis $H_0$ (that the observations are the result of pure chance) and the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ (that the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Statistic** - Identify a test statistic that can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. It is a value computed from sample data. The test statistic is used to assess the strength of evidence in support of a null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **P-value & Interpretation** - Compute the P-value, which is the probability that a test statistic, at least as significant as the one observed, would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis were true. The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence **against** the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Significance Level** - Compare the p-value to an acceptable significance value $\\alpha$ (sometimes called an $\\alpha$ value, a probability threshold below which the null hypothesis will be rejected. Common values are 5% and 1%.). If $p \\leq \\alpha$ (the observed effect is statistically significant), the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the 1970s, 20–29 year old men in the U.S. had a mean $\\mu$ body weight of 170 pounds. Standard deviation $\\sigma$ was 40 pounds. We test whether mean body weight in the population is bigger now.\n",

    "* Under the **null hypothesis** there is no difference in the mean body weight between then and now, in which case $\\mu$ would still equal 170 pounds: $$H_0: \\mu=170$$\n",
    "* Under the **alternative hypothesis**, the mean weight has increased: $$H_a: \\mu > 170$$\n",
    "    * This statement of the alternative hypothesis is one-sided. That is, it looks only for values larger than stated under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    * There is another way to state the alternative hypothesis. We could state it in a **“two-sided”** manner, looking for values that are either higher- or lower-than expected. For the current illustrative example, the two-sided alternative is $H_a: \\mu \\neq 170$. Although for the current illustrative example, this seems unnecessary, two-sided alternative offers several advantages and are much more common in practice.\n",
